# Issues Addressed from Feedback and Peer Review

## Expand on model results analysis and conclusion

This issue was based on Milestone 1 instuctor Feedback and 3 peer reviews.

By adding plots showing Logistic Regression coefficients across 7 wine quality score classes, we reinstate the potential lack of linearily in the problem as it is currently presented, given existing features. We clarified reasons why we are hesitant to apply further machine learning methods, such as including F1, recall scores, or choosing a different non-linear model, as we need better understanding of the data and what factors contribute to wine quality for red and white wines in real life. Without such understanding, we might incur risks of creating less effective features / models or increase possibilities of overfitting in the future.

## Add bar plots to show coefficients found by logistic regression

This issue was based on a peer review.

We added bar plots showing feature coefficients from logistic regression for each wine quality class, generated png files in appropriate directory, and updated scripts and Makefile.
