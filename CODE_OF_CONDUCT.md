# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive community, we pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

-   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
-   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
-   Providing constructive criticism gracefully
-   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
-   Focusing on what is best not just for the project, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

-   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Each member are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Each member have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and it also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Slack Group 2 with all the team members. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Guidelines

Failure to follow the code of conduct will result in a three-step warning system:

1\.   The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.

2\.   The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract is required by the member.

3\.   The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate
